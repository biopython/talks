Biopython is a long-running collaboration that provides a freely available Python library for biological computation. We summarise recent project news, and look ahead.

Releases 1.73 (December 2018) and 1.74 (expected May/June 2019) include improvements to various modules of the code base and continue the effort to document our public APIs, which we expect to complete this year. We have also focused on improving test coverage, currently at 85% (excluding online tests). Tests and Python PEP8/PEP257 style are checked with continuous integration on Linux (TravisCI) and Windows (AppVeyor). We are considering adopting the Python code formatting style tool 'black' to reduce human time writing compliant code.

In 2017 we started transitioning from our liberal but unique Biopython License Agreement to the similar but very widely used 3-Clause BSD License. Already half the files in the main library have been dual licensed after reviewing authorship, and all new contributions are dual licensed.

Finally, in the last year, Biopython had 32 named contributors, including 14 newcomers, reflecting our policy of encouraging even small contributions. We expect to reach 250 contributors by our 20th Birthday in August 2019.
